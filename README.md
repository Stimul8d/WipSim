# WipSim

Proof that doing five things at once makes everything take longer. Watch your dev team's productivity tank in real-time as you pile on the work.

## What it Shows

- Live simulation of work flowing (or not) through dev stages
- Context switching penalties (because your brain isn't a CPU)
- Impact of WIP limits on throughput and lead time
- Why your "urgent" ticket is making everything slower

Built because PowerPoints about Little's Law are boring and managers need to feel the pain.

## Features

- Task generation with configurable complexity and arrival rates
- Multi-skilled team simulation with context-switching costs
- Real-time metrics showing your poor life choices
- Examples from software dev, hospitals, and kitchens

## Dev Setup

```bash
# Get the code
pnpm install

# Start regretting your choices
pnpm dev
```

The irony of having multiple PRs in progress is not lost on us.

Inspired by every project manager who's ever said "Can't you just squeeze this quick one in?"

# WipSim

Shows why too much work in progress is a bad time. Smash tasks through your dev pipeline and watch productivity tank when you try to do everything at once.

## What's this then?

Interactive sim showing how context switching and work-in-progress limits affect your team's output. Built because PowerPoint slides about Little's Law make everyone fall asleep.

Features:
- Team simulation with skill specialties 
- Context switching penalties (brutal but realistic)
- Progress tracking per task
- Configurable workflow stages
- Example scenarios from software dev, hospitals and kitchens

## Local Dev

```bash
npm install   # Get the goods
npm run dev   # Fire it up
```

## Why?

Because every manager needs to learn that nine women can't make a baby in one month, and adding more work to an overloaded team is like trying to fill a pint glass with a fire hose.

## Stack

- SvelteKit (because React is chunky)
- Pico CSS (because no one likes maintaining CSS)
- TypeScript (because any: never)
